* Creating a To Do list with the Sping Framework


** Overview

This is not a full step by step tutorial, but some notes that could
one day be expanded to be a tutorial.  So it should be complete, but
also fast to write and probably terse.

Starting with a empty pivotal tracker project with stories and such,
we build a simple To Do list app in Spring Framework + MVC, using
spring boot and AngularJS for the front end.
