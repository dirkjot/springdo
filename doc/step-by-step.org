* Creating a To Do list with the Sping Framework


** Overview

This is not a full step by step tutorial, but some notes that could
one day be expanded to be a tutorial.  So it should be complete, but
also fast to write and probably terse.

Starting with a empty pivotal tracker project with stories and such,
we build a simple To Do list app in Spring Framework + MVC, using
spring boot and AngularJS for the front end.

* Starting the project

** commit 9b8e26267780faff87e6313db3c462965d3a916e
- Github project on https://github.com/dirkjot/springdo.git
- Cleaned up tracker project and stored it in a csv file (not on
  github yet)
- Started spring boot via http://start.spring.io
- `gradle wrapper`



** commit 2c695d6db9ce111298744a1d51aea8f0f3b33a64
- `gradle idea`   , this sets up the intellij project for you.
- `idea . ` (from project directory)
- added the spring facet to the top module
- we are now using eclipse?? settings which means the project does not
  go into the `.idea` directory
- similary, build does not only go into `build` but also into `out`.
- this compiles and runs, showing an generic whitepage error on localhost:8080/
- create a run/debug configuration by right clicking on the
  spriongdoApplication.java file and choosing run, then choose the
  option with the green leaf icon (spring).   See screenshot.



** commit bea91975d47397339ef5a3e655ca1b2378c5a941

we pulled in angular + bootstrap.   following advice  from spriong
tutorial #2 (refer here),  we created our own js/css main file.   this
used wro4j in some intricate way, see springbeachproject. essentially,
it combines and minifies all js/css.

** commit ce2df0ddda289dc1c5d33b6445fe20bc80f39d42

fixed the first user story, but at json level only.  ie / returns a
json array of two todo items. 

** commit 2285a53a1a0267e14078c0553f5c41ef3ffed4f2

added some simple angular structure to iterate over the list of todo
items (using ng-repeat).  Move the json to `/resource/` . 

** commit 4c90cc917465c03c649ce0c709a8f309261c87a8

created a link with github as follows:
- go to your profile page on tracker
- find api key (long hex number)
- go to github, project setttings, webhooks and services
- under services, choose pivotal tracker and enter api key.  


** commit 4e11bb268d0fa0d4fbc005d300520c1218313fa6

- added checkboxes to UI as requested by story
- factored placeholder data to be created on application boot. 
- Created Item model and added checkboxes. 
- Selection of checkboxes is posted to the controller and persisted.
- found out how to do db init at startup, see snippet below

* things to remember /snippets

** to run commands right after boot startup

make your app extend 'commandlinerunner' and then override the run method:

package io.pivotal;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringdoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    
    @Autowired
    ItemRepository itemRepository;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringdoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
        // save a couple of customers
        itemRepository.save(new Item("Jack", "Bauer"));
        itemRepository.save(new Item("Chloe", "O'Brian"));
        itemRepository.save(new Item("Kim", "Bauer"));
        itemRepository.save(new Item("David", "Palmer"));
        itemRepository.save(new Item("Michelle", "Dessler"));
    }

}






** to convert an iterable (also an iterator) to a list

in java 8 , you can use a lambda and some good functional syntax:

Iterable<Item> iterable = itemRepository.findAll();
List<Item> result = new ArrayList<>();
iterable.iterator().forEachRemaining(result::add);

- the first line creates an iterable (abstract), which will be
  'instantiated' to an iterator in line 3
- the second line creates an empty list of the right type 
- the third line maps the add function of the empty list to each item
  of the iterator.
- voila
