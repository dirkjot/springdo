* repo

** branches

tried to move the master branch to history and such, but this creates a lot of confusion.  

* procedure

- create org file with txt extension
- export to html
- view and copy all html
- in blogger , paste it in (maybe first go to html, delete all, back to normal)
- fix links in html mode
- hit publish in html mode

* relative links

all links in blogger that point into the same doc are broken .  this seems to be a known blogger issue since 2010.

FIX: go into html mode and edit the links. do not switch back to normal mode before hitting publish. 


** publish

tried this in the hope that it would create relative links.  it does but blogger still butchers them to be absolute to a wrong address. 

(require 'ox-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(
      ("tut-notes"
        :base-directory "/Users/pivotal/Google Drive/code/springdo.hub0"
        :base-extension "txt"
	:publishing-directory "/Users/pivotal/Google Drive/code/publish"
	 :recursive t
	  :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
 	  :headline-levels 4             ; Just the default for this project.
	  :html-link-use-abs-url nil
 	  :auto-preamble t )

("tut-static"
  :base-directory "/Users/pivotal/Google Drive/code/springdo.hub0"
 :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
 :publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
 :recursive t
 :publishing-function org-publish-attachment
 )

("tut" :components ("org-notes" "tut-static"))
))


* things to do
** TODO write js to fix internal links
